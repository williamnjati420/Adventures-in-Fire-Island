        <section> <p>When I first arrived at Fire Island, I was struck by how different it felt from the mainland. The moment I stepped off the ferry, everything slowed down—the air smelled of salt and dune grass, and the only sounds were distant waves and the occasional bicycle bell. I remember walking along the boardwalk toward the dunes, feeling like I had suddenly entered a quiet, self-contained world. It was peaceful in a way that’s hard to put into words, as if the island insisted you breathe a little deeper and move a little easier.</p></section>
        <section> <p>During my hike along the Sunken Forest trail, I was amazed at how alive the place felt. The twisted holly trees created a natural canopy that filtered the sunlight into soft, warm stripes across the path. I took my time wandering through the preserve, stopping every few minutes to listen—birds calling from hidden branches, insects humming in the undergrowth, wind sweeping across the leaves. It made the whole experience feel almost surreal, like I was walking through a space protected from time. I’d never seen an ecosystem that felt so wild yet so delicate at the same moment.</p></section>
        <section> <p>Later in the afternoon, I made my way to the beach, where the waves were rolling in steadily under a bright, open sky. I spent a long while sitting near the shoreline, letting the cold water rush over my feet while I watched gulls drift overhead. There was something grounding about that moment—just me, the sand, and the endless stretch of Atlantic blue. As the sun began to set, the sky turned orange and violet, and I remember thinking that Fire Island wasn’t just a place you visit; it was a place you feel. It’s a memory that stayed with me long after I left the island.</p> </section>
